# Rock Paper Scissors 2017

- This is an old project I decided to put on github for archival reasons. I will probably redo this later on using a framework such as react or vue js later on. In the meantime...

# Features

- A smart AI ( but, beatable )
- A nice interface and design
- A player scoreboard (although buggy at times.)

## Bugs

- Player 2 Scoreboard doesn't update during the game. You have to refresh in order for it to update properly.

### Notes

- I do not own rock paper sissor pictures. This project was only for fun and personal use and wasn't ment to be used commercially. Credit goes to the authors. I would put there names down but, this project is about a year and a half old and I can't remember the author names.
